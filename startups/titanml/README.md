## Description
Meet TitanML: The Infrastructure Building the Future of Deep Learning. We are excited to highlight TitanML as today's featured AI startup! The team, led by CEO Meryem Arik, is developing the critical infrastructure needed to advance deep learning.

TitanML is focused on empowering ML engineers to overcome critical obstacles in building impactful AI applications - expensive GPUs, slow performance, and long development cycles. 

Their Takeoff inference server offers clever solutions:
- üöÄ Model Compression - Deploy smaller, faster, cheaper language models through compression
- üöÄ Output Controllers - Improve model quality and reliability for downstream uses
- üöÄ Accelerated Development - Get started faster with out-of-the-box infrastructure instead of building from scratch

With these innovations, TitanML is making deep learning more accessible and higher-quality for the enterprise. Engineers can concentrate more on creating great models rather than just making things work.

TitanML's infrastructure represents the future of how companies will leverage AI. It tackles the underlying challenges that often hinder real-world usage. More efficient and reliable deep learning unlocks new opportunities.

By sharing the foundations for impactful model development, TitanML empowers enterprises to create next-generation AI on top of their Takeoff inference server. 

Check out TitanML to learn more about their offerings and vision.
