## Description
Meet Superlinked: The Vector Compute Startup Democratizing AI. Superlinked is our AI startup of the day! The team led by Ben is building a vector compute infrastructure platform that puts more control of AI in the hands of organizations and individuals.

Superlinked allows users to combine data types into a shared vector embedding space. It enables various AI applications like fraud detection, recommendations, and semantic search.

The key differentiation is that you retain complete control over what data goes into your vector space and the relative importance of each data type. It makes Superlinked a more transparent, customizable, and responsible approach to AI.

Some potential use cases include:
- üïµÔ∏è Fraud detection that combines transaction, location, and device data.
- üéØ Ultra-personalized recommendations that factor in preferences, browse history, and more.
- üîç Semantic search that understands meaning and connections across content.

Superlinked is building the future of AI with generative models and vector embeddings. They aim to democratize access to advanced AI while ensuring thoughtful oversight over its application.
