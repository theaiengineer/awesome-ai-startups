## Description
Meet Mystic AI: Democratizing Access to AI Infrastructure. We are excited to highlight Mystic as today's featured AI startup! 🚀 The team around Oscar Rovira ✨ is trying to make deploying and scaling Machine Learning models radically easier. 🆙

Mystic lets developers run machine learning models through a simple API without any infrastructure hassle. 💻 Their serverless offering means you only pay per second of inference time. 💸

Behind the scenes, Mystic handles seamless optimization across thousands of models, each with unique environments and scale needs. ⚙️ The result is fast, reliable performance whether you need to serve 5 or 5 million users. 📈
What really stands out is how Mystic expands access to AI's potential. 🙌

Their community marketplace features cutting-edge models anyone can try through the API. 🤝 So, you can build apps powered by innovations like Stable Diffusion without being an expert. 🎨

For enterprises, Mystic deploys on your own infrastructure for maximum security. 🔒 But the same effortless experience remains to run models at scale—no need to juggle data science and DevOps. 🧑‍💻

By tackling deployment complexity, Mystic lets you focus on creating revolutionary solutions with AI. 💡

We encourage you to check them out! 👀
